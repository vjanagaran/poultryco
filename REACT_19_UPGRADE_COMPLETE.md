# React 19 Monorepo Upgrade - Complete! ✅

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Both Web and Mobile Apps Now Use React 19  
**Dev Server:** Running at http://localhost:3000

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue:**
- Mobile app required React 19.1.0 (React Native 0.81)
- Web app was configured for React 18.2.0 (Next.js 14)
- npm workspaces was hoisting packages causing conflicts
- Next.js couldn't find React modules

**Solution:**
- Upgraded web app to Next.js 15 (supports React 19)
- Aligned all packages to use React 19
- Updated design-system package peer dependencies
- Fixed CSS syntax for Next.js 15 compatibility

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Web App Package (`apps/web/package.json`)**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^15.0.0",        // Upgraded from 14.2.0
    "react": "^19.0.0",       // Upgraded from 18.2.0
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0"    // Upgraded from 18.2.0
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^19.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19.0.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "^15.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Design System Package (`packages/design-system/package.json`)**
```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^19.0.0",           // Updated from 18.0.0
    "react-native": "^0.81.0"     // Updated from 0.73.0
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^19.0.0"     // Updated from 18.2.0
  }
}
```

### 3. **Global CSS (`apps/web/src/app/globals.css`)**
Fixed Tailwind CSS syntax for Next.js 15:
```css
/* Before */
@apply border-border;

/* After */
border-color: hsl(var(--border));
```

# Using nvm
nvm install 20.19.4
nvm use 20.19.4
```

Next.js 15 has some breaking changes from 14:
- Improved caching behavior
- Better TypeScript support
- React 19 support (required for our setup)
