  - 1 farmer knows local price
  - 5,000 farmers know regional trends
  - Price manipulation becomes impossible

- **More Vets = Faster Help:**
  - Isolated vet: Limited to 15km radius
  - 50 vets networked: Someone always available 24/7
  - Emergency coverage increases

- **More Suppliers = Quality Competition:**
  - Few suppliers: Monopoly pricing
  - 100+ suppliers: Competitive pricing + quality focus

**Source:** Network theory, marketplace dynamics
