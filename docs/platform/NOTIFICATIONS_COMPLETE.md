**Privacy:**
- Notifications only sent to relevant users
- Content preview limited to 100-500 chars
- Sensitive data not exposed
- Deleted entities cascade delete notifications

- [ ] Notification categories

### Low Priority:
- [ ] Custom notification sounds
- [ ] Notification history export
- [ ] Advanced filters (date range, priority)
- [ ] Notification analytics

## üìù API Reference

### Fetch Notifications
```typescript
const notifications = await fetchNotifications(limit, offset, unreadOnly);
```

### Get Unread Count
```typescript
const count = await getUnreadCount();
```

### Mark as Read
```typescript
// Mark specific
await markAsRead(['notif-id-1', 'notif-id-2']);

// Mark single
await markNotificationAsRead('notif-id');

// Mark all
await markAllAsRead();
```

### Create Notification (Manual)
```typescript
await createNotification(
  recipientId,
  senderId,
  'post_like',
  'post',
  postId,
  'John liked your post',
  'Post content preview...',
  '/stream?post=123',
  'normal'
);
```

### Create Mention Notifications (Auto)
```typescript
await createMentionNotifications(
  postId,
  postContent,
  authorId,
  authorName
);
```

### Real-time Subscription
```typescript
const unsubscribe = subscribeToNotifications(
  userId,
  (notification) => {
    console.log('New notification:', notification);
  },
  (count) => {
    console.log('Unread count:', count);
  }
);

// Cleanup
unsubscribe();

## üí° Implementation Notes

### Why Triggers Instead of Application Code?

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed delivery (database-level)
- ‚úÖ No race conditions
- ‚úÖ Consistent across all clients
- ‚úÖ Less application code
- ‚úÖ Better performance

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Harder to debug
- ‚ùå Less flexible
- ‚ùå Requires database access to modify

**Solution:** Use triggers for automated notifications (likes, comments) and application code for complex notifications (@mentions that require content parsing).

### Notification Delivery Channels

**in_app:** Always delivered (stored in database)  
**email:** Based on preferences + quiet hours  
**push:** Mobile only, based on preferences  
**sms:** Premium feature (not implemented)  
**whatsapp:** Premium feature (not implemented)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing:
- Check database triggers are installed
- Verify RLS policies
- Check real-time subscription active
- Inspect browser console for errors

### Unread count not updating:
- Check real-time subscription
- Verify `get_unread_notifications_count()` function
- Check network connection

### Browser notifications not showing:
- Permission must be granted
- HTTPS required (or localhost)
- Check browser notification settings
