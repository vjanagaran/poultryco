## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Icon Strategy
**Issue:** `lucide-react` had React type conflicts with Next.js 15  
**Solution:** Used emoji icons as a temporary solution
- 🔍 Search
- ⭐ Rating/Premium
- ✓ Verified
- 📍 Location
- 👥 Connections/Followers
- 🛡️ Certified
- 📈 Trending
- 📦 Top Seller

**Future:** Can be replaced with proper icon library once type issues are resolved.

### State Management
**Chosen:** Zustand over Redux
- Simpler API
- Better TypeScript support
- Smaller bundle size
- Built-in devtools

### Data Fetching
**Pattern:** Direct Supabase queries (not React Query yet)
- Keeps it simple for MVP
- Easy to migrate to React Query later
- Server components can use direct queries

## 🚀 Build Success

**Final Build Output:**
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Collecting build traces
✓ Finalizing page optimization

Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
┌ ○ /discover                           ...      ...
├ ○ /discover/members                   ...      ...

└ ○ /discover/jobs                      ...      ...
```

**Warnings:** Only pre-existing ESLint warnings (any types, unused vars) - No new errors!
