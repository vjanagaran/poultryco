## 💾 Offline Architecture

### IndexedDB Schema
```
poultryco_stream (DB)
├── posts (max 100)
│   ├── Indexes: by-cached-at, by-priority, by-created-at
│   └── LRU rotation with priority scoring
├── pending_posts (unlimited)
│   ├── Queue for offline-created posts
│   └── Retry logic with exponential backoff
├── mention_cache (max 50)
│   ├── Top 50 most-mentioned users
│   └── LRU eviction
└── hashtag_cache (max 50)
    ├── Top 50 most-used hashtags
    └── LRU eviction
```

### Cache Priority Scoring
```typescript
priority = (
  likes_count * 2 +
  comments_count * 3 +
  shares_count * 1.5 +
  (user_liked ? 10 : 0) +
  (user_saved ? 20 : 0) +
  (is_own_post ? 15 : 0) +
  recency_score (0-100)
)
```

**High Priority (Never Evicted):**
- User's own posts
- Saved/bookmarked posts

**Medium Priority:**
- Posts with user interactions
- Posts from connections
- High engagement posts

**Low Priority (Evicted First):**
- Old posts (>7 days)
- Low engagement posts
- Public posts from non-connections
