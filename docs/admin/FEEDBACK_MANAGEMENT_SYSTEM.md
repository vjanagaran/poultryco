# Feedback Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive, AI-powered feedback management system designed to collect, analyze, and act on user feedback to drive product improvements and enhance user satisfaction.

## System Architecture

### 1. Feedback Collection Points

#### In-App CTAs
- **Header**: "Give Feedback" button (persistent)
- **Footer**: "Suggestions?" link
- **Empty States**: "Help us improve" prompts
- **Error Pages**: "Report this issue" 
- **Feature Pages**: Context-specific feedback
- **Post-Action**: Success screens with feedback prompt

#### Trigger Points
- After completing profile (satisfaction check)
- First post creation (experience feedback)
- After 7 days of usage (NPS survey)
- Feature usage milestones
- Error encounters

### 2. Feedback Categories & Routing

| Category | Priority | Response Time | Auto-Tags |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Bug Report | High/Urgent | 24 hours | technical, bug, error |
| Feature Request | Medium | 48 hours | enhancement, feature |
| UX Feedback | Medium | 72 hours | design, usability |
| Performance | High | 24 hours | speed, slow, loading |
| Content | Low | 1 week | content, quality |
| Mobile App | High | 48 hours | mobile, app |
| Integration | Medium | 72 hours | api, integration |
| Other | Low | 1 week | general |

### 3. AI-Powered Analysis

#### Sentiment Analysis
- **Positive** (0.5 to 1.0): Happy users, testimonials
- **Neutral** (-0.5 to 0.5): Suggestions, observations  
- **Negative** (-1.0 to -0.5): Complaints, frustrations
- **Mixed**: Complex feedback with multiple sentiments

#### Auto-Tagging System
Uses NLP to identify:
- **Features**: profile, messaging, search, feed
- **Issues**: bug, crash, slow, broken
- **Themes**: onboarding, discovery, networking
- **Components**: button, form, navigation
- **Emotions**: frustrated, confused, happy, satisfied

#### Insight Generation
- **Pattern Detection**: Similar feedback clustering
- **Trend Analysis**: Rising/falling issue types
- **Root Cause**: Common underlying problems
- **Impact Assessment**: User segment affected
