# Connection System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The connection system allows users to connect with each other on the PoultryCo platform. With the database triggers now fixed, the system works seamlessly with automatic notifications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Send Connection Request ✅
- Users can send connection requests from:
  - Member cards in the discover page
  - Profile pages of other users
- Duplicate requests are prevented
- Real-time status updates in UI

### 2. Connection Status Checking ✅
- Automatic status check on component mount
- Shows different states:
  - **Not Connected**: Shows "Connect" button
  - **Pending (Requester)**: Shows "✓ Request Sent"
  - **Pending (Recipient)**: Shows "Pending Approval"
  - **Connected**: Shows "✓ Connected"

### 3. Accept/Reject Connections ✅
- API functions to accept or reject pending requests
- `PendingConnectionsList` component to manage requests
- Real-time UI updates after actions

### 4. Automatic Notifications ✅
- Database triggers create notifications automatically
- Connection request notifications
- Connection accepted notifications

## UI Components

- Consistent UI states

### PendingConnectionsList

- Can be integrated into notifications or dashboard

## Database Structure

### Connections Table
```sql
- id: UUID
- profile_id_1: UUID (smaller ID)
- profile_id_2: UUID (larger ID)
- status: pending | connected | blocked
- requested_by: UUID
- requested_at: timestamp
- responded_at: timestamp
```

### Triggers
- `notify_connection_request`: Creates notification on new request
- `notify_connection_accepted`: Creates notification when accepted

## Integration Points

### Dashboard
Add the PendingConnectionsList component to show pending requests:
```tsx
import { PendingConnectionsList } from '@/components/connections/PendingConnectionsList';

// In your dashboard or notifications page
<section>
  <h2>Pending Connection Requests</h2>
  <PendingConnectionsList />
</section>
```

### Profile Pages
The ProfileHeader already includes full connection functionality.

### Discover Pages
MemberCard components include connection functionality.
