## THE STORY (Homepage Version - CORRECTED)

### Born Into Farming. Built Technology for Corporations. Returned to Serve My Roots.

My mother raised hens in our backyard to fund my education. Every bird she cared for was an investment in my future. I became the first graduate from my family at College of Engineering, Guindy, and built enterprise ERP solutions across UAE, Oman, and Malaysia.

COVID brought me back to my village.

My friend Prabharan was managing 7 lakh birds—on paper. Late nights manually calculating feed ratios. Lost data from past cycles. No way to learn, no way to improve. While I'd been building sophisticated ERPs for corporations who could afford anything.

That disconnect hit hard.

I founded PoultryCare ERP in 2022. Today, we serve 35+ enterprise clients across 8 countries—operations managing up to ₹1,000 Cr annual turnover. But individual success wasn't enough. I researched why poultry farming remains a decade behind other industries in technology adoption.

The answer: Farmers have no control over market prices, productivity, or demand. They can't ask hens to stop laying eggs when margins are thin. So individual farmers can't afford R&D or bear transformation risk alone.

Then Steve Jobs' bicycle metaphor clicked: "Research proved bicycles transformed humans from 47th to 1st in efficiency."

**What's the bicycle for poultry industry? Every stakeholder under one roof.**

That's why we built **PTIC** (PoultryTech Innovation Council)—a Section 8 non-profit to democratize technology.

At **PTSE 1st Edition** (June 29, 2024, Namakkal), veteran farmer Mr. Singaraj stood up: *"We lose thousands of birds to heat stroke. The information exists—somewhere in WhatsApp groups, somewhere with experts we cannot reach."*

At **PTSE 2nd Edition** (January 25, 2025, Coimbatore), we made a public promise with StartupTN backing: We will build the bridge.

At **PTSE 3rd Edition** (February 2026), we're delivering: **PoultryCo**—tools used by large integrators, now available to every farmer. Free. Simple. Built by poultry people, for poultry people.

This is my debt to the birds my mother raised.  
This is transformation, not just digitization.  
This is **Grow Together®**.
