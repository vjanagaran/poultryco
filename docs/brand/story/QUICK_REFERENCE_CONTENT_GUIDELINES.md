# PoultryCo Story Guidelines - Quick Reference Card
**Print This & Keep Handy When Creating Content**

---

## 🎯 **THE GOLDEN RULE**

### **EMPATHY, NOT SYMPATHY**
- ✅ We want: "I know that sacrifice" (peer connection)
- ❌ We avoid: "That's so sad" (pity from above)

---

## 📸 **PHOTO APPROVAL MATRIX**

| Photo Type | Status | Quick Check |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| PTSE events | ✅ YES | Public, credible |
| Founder + Prabharan | ✅ YES | Partnership, collaboration |
| Development team | ✅ YES | Transparency |
| Generic farm scenes | ✅ YES | No faces, universal |
| Typography quotes | ✅ YES | Reader imagination |
| **Mother's photo** | ❌ NEVER | Privacy + sympathy risk |
| **Family members** | ❌ NEVER | Boundary respect |
| **Poverty imagery** | ❌ NEVER | Wrong frame |

---

## 💬 **LANGUAGE GUIDE**

### **✅ USE**
- Born into farming family
- Mother's poultry funded education
- Like millions of families across India
- Debt to the industry
- First graduate from family

### **❌ AVOID**
- We were so poor that...
- Escaped rural life
- Made it out
- From nothing to something
- Before/after success story

---

## 🚨 **RED FLAGS - STOP IF YOU SEE**

- 🚩 Poverty narrative emerging
- 🚩 "Inspiration porn" framing
- 🚩 Savior/hero positioning
- 🚩 Family members as props
- 🚩 Reader pity instead of recognition
- 🚩 Personal journey overshadowing mission

**Action**: Return to master doc, realign content

## ✅ **5 QUESTIONS BEFORE PUBLISHING**

1. **Does this create empathy or sympathy?**
2. **Does this respect personal boundaries?**
3. **Does this focus on mission or personal journey?**
4. **Does founder seem like peer or savior?**
5. **Does this honor without exploiting?**

**If ANY answer is wrong → Revise or remove**

---

## 🎭 **THE EMPTY CHAIR TECHNIQUE**

**Principle**: What you DON'T show is often more powerful

**Application**: 
- No mother's photo = Every reader projects THEIR family
- Result: Universal connection, not individual case study
- Effect: "OUR story" not "HIS story"

---

## 📊 **CONTENT FOCUS HIERARCHY**

**60% PRIMARY**: PTSE, platform, ecosystem, transformation  
**30% SECONDARY**: Partnerships, technology, development  
**10% MINIMAL**: Personal background (text only, no photos)

---

## 🎯 **POSITIONING FRAME**

### **✅ CORRECT**
- Focus: Obligation, service, debt repayment
- Tone: Peer-to-peer, collaborative
- Message: "I understand because I'm FROM here"
- Frame: Industry transformation through ecosystem

### **❌ WRONG**
- Focus: Personal achievement, escape, success
- Tone: Benefactor to beneficiary
- Message: "I succeeded despite circumstances"
- Frame: Individual rags-to-riches story

---

## 💡 **WHEN IN DOUBT**

Choose:
- Text over photo
- Generic over specific
- Universal over individual
- Mission over personal
- Empty chair over filled frame

---

## 🎯 **THREE-LAYER STORY CHECK**

**Layer 2 - PTIC**: Structural solution, ecosystem approach

## ⚖️ **THE BALANCE**

**Story Power** = Specific enough to be credible + Universal enough to be relatable

- Too specific (with mother's photo) → Becomes individual case study
- Too generic (no details) → Loses authenticity
- **Just right** (our approach) → Credible AND universal

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

**Your content is WORKING if readers say**:
- ✅ "I know that sacrifice"
- ✅ "My family did that too"
- ✅ "This is exactly what we need"
- ✅ "I want to be part of this"

**Your content is FAILING if readers say**:
- ❌ "Poor guy, glad he made it"
- ❌ "What a sad story"
- ❌ "He's so inspiring" (in pity tone)
- ❌ "I could never do that"

## 📞 **WHO TO CONSULT**

**Questions about**:
- Photo usage → Reference this card + master doc

4. **Mission focus** (industry over individual)
5. **Empty chair** (reader participation)
