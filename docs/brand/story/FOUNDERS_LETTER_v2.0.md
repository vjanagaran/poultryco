# A Letter to the Poultry Community

## Dear Friend,

Let me tell you a story you probably won't find in typical startup origin tales. It's not about a Silicon Valley garage or a brilliant "aha" moment. It's about birds. Specifically, about the hens my mother raised in our backyard in a small village in Tamil Nadu.

Those birds were more than livestock. They were our **family's hope**. Every egg they laid, every chick they hatched—that was grocery money, school fees, a future that seemed impossible. They were the foundation that held our lives together.

I was the first person in my entire family to go to college. Not just any college—College of Engineering, Guindy. A dream so big that most people in our village didn't dare dream it. But my mother dared. And those birds made it possible.

### The Weight of Success

I did what was expected. Built a career in technology. Worked on enterprise ERP systems across UAE, Oman, Malaysia, and several other countries. By conventional measures, I'd "made it." First-generation graduate. International career. Corporate success.

But there was always a question I couldn't answer: **My mother's birds gave me this opportunity. What am I giving back to the industry that raised me?**

That question kept me awake at night. It followed me through every corporate meeting, every successful project delivery, every achievement that should have felt complete but somehow didn't.

### COVID Forced My Hand

When the pandemic hit, I returned to my village. Not by choice initially—circumstances forced it. But maybe I needed that force. Maybe I'd been avoiding what I knew I had to do.

That's when I spent real time with my friend Prabharan. He runs a serious commercial poultry operation. Not backyard farming like my mother did—he's managing **7 lakh birds**. That's 700,000 birds. A ₹1 Crore+ annual turnover operation with 10 staff members.

And he was managing all of it **on paper.**

Let that sink in. In 2020-2021, while the world ran on cloud software, while single-owner tea shops used digital POS systems, a multi-crore poultry operation was using pen, paper, and late-night manual calculations.

I watched Prabharan struggle. Late nights after 12-hour farm days, trying to manually track everything. No historical data. No way to learn from past cycles. Just survival, day after day.

**The irony was crushing.** I'd been building sophisticated ERPs for corporations who threw six-figure budgets at software. Meanwhile, farmers producing **actual food** for millions—farmers like my mother—couldn't access even basic tools.

### We Built PoultryCare Together

That's when PoultryCare ERP was born in 2022. Prabharan became an invaluable advisory board member and mentor. I brought the technology experience. He brought decades of farming wisdom. We built it together from the ground up.

It worked. Today, PoultryCare serves **35+ enterprise clients across 8 countries**—Oman, Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, and others. We handle operations managing **12 lakh+ birds** in layer farms, **800+ integrator farms**, and **feed mills with up to ₹1,000 Crore annual turnover**.

Farmers who adopted it saw real results. Better tracking. Optimized operations. Data-driven decisions.

**But our success revealed a harder truth.** We were serving the privileged few who could afford enterprise solutions. The broader industry—the 60% independent farmers who needed help most—remained trapped.

### The Research That Changed Everything

I spent months researching. The answer wasn't what I expected.

PoultryCare worked great for our clients because they were educated, second-generation farmers or large commercial operations. They could afford to experiment. They had time to learn.

But they represented maybe 5-10% of the industry.

**The bigger question**: Could we transform an entire industry by digitizing a few privileged farmers?

**The painful answer**: No.

Then I discovered something that shocked me: **The poultry industry is almost a decade behind other industries in technology adoption.**

Think about it:
- Electronics: Hundreds of phones per hour, fully automated, 24/7
- Automotive: One car per minute with robotic precision
- E-commerce: Amazon processing tens of thousands of packages per hour
- Retail: Even small tea shops run cloud POS systems
- Poultry: ₹1 Cr+ operations still managing on paper

### The Question That Saved Me

**Why?**

Why is agriculture always last to adopt technology? Why do farmers struggle to afford what other industries take for granted?

The answer is brutally simple: **Farmers have no control over prices.**

Defense can justify any cost—national security.  
Healthcare can charge premium—nobody bargains on health.  
Manufacturing can price in technology—they control product costs.  
Retail can add to MRP—consumers pay for convenience.

But farmers? They can't ask hens to stop laying eggs when market prices drop. They can't control productivity. They can't control demand. **Margins are razor-thin.**

So individual farmers can't afford individual R&D. Can't bear transformation risk alone. **The trap is perfect.**

And that's when I remembered Steve Jobs' bicycle metaphor.

### The Bicycle Moment

Jobs once referenced research proving that **bicycles transformed humans from 47th to 1st in efficiency** among all species. Not through evolution. Through a tool that multiplied existing capability.

I asked myself: **What's the bicycle for the poultry industry?**

The answer hit me: **Every stakeholder under one roof.**

Individual farmers can't afford transformation alone. But what if they didn't have to? What if we assembled all the components—farmers, vets, vendors, researchers—into one ecosystem?

- Shared learning eliminates risk
- Direct connections stop leakage
- Collective expertise covers all gaps
- Community approach makes it affordable
- Collaboration enables customization

**That's when PTIC was born.**

### Why PTIC Had to Be Non-Profit

In early 2024, Prabharan and I, along with other associates, began discussing this vision. We could have built PoultryCo as a for-profit business. But farmers would always wonder: "What's the hidden agenda?"

So we created **PTIC—PoultryTech Innovation Council**—as a Section 8 non-profit under India's Companies Act 2013. This structure **legally prohibits profit distribution**. Our mission isn't a marketing claim—it's enshrined in our legal charter.

Here's the strategic reality: Large integrators like Suguna, Venky's, and Godrej already serve the 40% of contract farmers with expensive ERPs. They're doing fine.

**PTIC serves the forgotten 60%**—independent farmers who can't afford enterprise solutions. There's no commercial conflict. We're not competing; we're complementing.

### The Moment That Made It Real

At PTSE 1st Edition on **June 29, 2024**, at Hotel Golden Palace in Namakkal, 800+ industry stakeholders gathered. I stood on that stage and announced PTIC's formation—our vision for bringing every stakeholder together.

Then something happened that changed everything.

A veteran farmer stood up. Mr. Singaraj—30+ years in poultry, founding chairman of Ponni Group, NECC Namakkal chairman. A voice the industry respects.

He said: *"We lose thousands of birds to heat stroke. The information we need exists—somewhere in WhatsApp groups, somewhere with experts we cannot reach."*

The room went silent.

That wasn't one farmer's problem. **That was the entire industry crying out through one respected voice.**

### The Promise I Made

At PTSE 2nd Edition on **January 25, 2025**, at Hotel Le Meridien in Coimbatore, with Mr. Sivarajah (Mission Director and CEO of StartupTN) as chief guest, I stood on that same stage and made a **public promise**:

**We will build the bridge Mr. Singaraj asked for.**

Not quietly. Not tentatively. Publicly. In front of the industry. With government backing. With associations watching.

**February 2026. PTSE 3rd Edition. We're delivering.**

### Leading PoultryCo as a Tech Stakeholder

As the founder of PoultryCare ERP, I'm a stakeholder in this industry. Technology is my specialty. So when PTIC formed, it made sense for me to lead the PoultryCo initiative—proving what one committed stakeholder can achieve.

In September 2025, five computer science students from KSR College joined us for a 6-month commitment, along with a junior developer coordinator. We're using AI-first development methods and modern technology stack.

As of November, we're 20% complete—foundation set, authentication working, functional modules coming online.

Three farmer associations have partnered with us: TNPFA, BCC, and PFRC. We're in discussions with five Farmer Producer Organizations to expand systematically.

**This is me proving that one stakeholder, with deep industry knowledge and commitment, can catalyze transformation.**

### What I'm Asking From You

I'm not asking you to invest money. I'm not asking you to take financial risk.

**I'm asking you to join this platform and contribute your expertise.**

- Share what you know freely
- Help farmers who face what you've already solved
- Build your reputation through genuine contribution
- Grow with the community

**Individual success creates collective prosperity.** That's not marketing speak. That's the fundamental philosophy of "Grow Together®."

### The Accountability Date

**February 2026. PTSE 3rd Edition.**

We made a promise. We set a timeline. We're accountable.

That date isn't just a launch event. **It's proof that when the industry calls out in pain, someone listens, someone builds, someone delivers.**

### From Backyard Birds to Industry Transformation

My journey began with a mother's birds in a rural backyard. It led through corporate success and PoultryCare ERP serving operations across 8 countries. It crystallized with PTIC's formation. And now it's building that reality through PoultryCo.

**This is why I'm leading PoultryCo.**

Not as a business opportunity.  
As an obligation to the birds that raised me.  
As a debt to the mother who dared to dream.  
As a bridge for the industry that's been waiting.

Join us. Not as users. **As co-builders.**

This transformation happens together, or not at all.

With gratitude and commitment,

**Janagaran**  
Founder, PoultryCare ERP (35+ clients, 8+ countries)  
Co-founder & Promoter, PoultryTech Innovation Council (PTIC)  
Initiative Leader, PoultryCo Platform

*P.S. - If my mother's backyard hens could fund an engineering education, imagine what an entire industry working together could achieve. That's not hope. That's the mathematics of collaboration.*
