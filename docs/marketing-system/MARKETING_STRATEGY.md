3. **Pain Point:** Current problems (e.g., "High mortality in summer")
4. **Problem:** Systemic issues (e.g., "Inconsistent vaccine supply")
5. **Fear:** Concerns and risks (e.g., "Disease outbreak prevention")
6. **Fantasy:** Ideal outcomes (e.g., "Fully automated farm management")

### Content Workflow (2-Level System)

```
Topic → Pillar → Content → Schedule
```

#### Level 1: Content Pillar
- **Purpose:** Deep research on a core topic
- **Examples:** 
  - PoultryCo Origin Story
  - Complete Guide to Broiler Mortality
  - Feed Optimization Framework
- **Components:**

  - Source documents & references
  - Key insights & findings
  - Target URL for SEO backlinks

  ↓ (deep research)
4 Blog Articles (master content)
  ↓ (repurpose)
40 Social Posts (10 formats × 4 blogs)
= 44 Total Content Pieces
```

**Time Savings:**
