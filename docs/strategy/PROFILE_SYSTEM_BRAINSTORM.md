- Search by location + service

## 🎯 Proposed Profile Type Matrix

### Hybrid Approach: Personal + Business Roles

| Profile Type | Primary Use | URL Pattern | Focus |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Personal (Expert)** | Individual professionals | `/me/<slug>` | Expertise, services, consulting |
| **Business (Supplier)** | Product/service sellers | `/com/<slug>` | Catalog, inventory, orders |
| **Organization (Community)** | Associations, networks | `/org/<slug>` | Membership, events, advocacy |
| **Farm (Buyer)** | Farmers (can be personal or business) | `/farm/<slug>` | Requirements, capacity, collaboration |

**Key Innovation:** A person can have BOTH personal AND business profiles
- Personal profile = Expert consultant
- Business profile = Owns a feed mill
