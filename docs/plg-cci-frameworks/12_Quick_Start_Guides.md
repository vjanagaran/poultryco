### Evening (2 hours): Public Commitment

**6:00-8:00 PM: Announce Publicly**

```
WHY PUBLIC COMMITMENT:
• Accountability (can't back out)
• Support (people will help)
• Momentum (creates energy)
• Recruiting (attracts talent)

WHERE TO ANNOUNCE:
1. LinkedIn (industry)
2. WhatsApp Status (personal network)
3. PTIC group (association)
4. PoultryCare customers (early adopters)
```

**LinkedIn Post Template:**

```
ANNOUNCEMENT 📢

Excited to share that we're building something new for the 
Indian poultry industry: PoultryCo - a professional networking 
platform for farmers, veterinarians, and industry professionals.

WHY WE'RE BUILDING THIS:
• 60% of farmers (under 100K birds) are underserved by tech
• Industry is fragmented - no common platform
• Knowledge sharing happens in silos
• Small farmers need tools they can't afford

WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:
• Free professional profiles (like LinkedIn for poultry)
• Industry-specific tools (FCR calculator, mortality tracker)
• Q&A community (like Stack Overflow for farming)
• Knowledge sharing (learn from each other)

TIMELINE:
• 12 weeks to MVP
• Launch: January 25, 2025 at PTSE 3rd Edition
• Goal: 1,000 farmers in Year 1

This is in addition to PoultryCare ERP (which serves commercial 
farms). PoultryCo creates the top of our funnel and genuinely 
serves the market that can't afford paid solutions yet.

If you're a poultry farmer, vet, or industry professional, 
I'd love your input. DM me!

#PoultryTech #AgTech #PoultryCo #PTIC #Innovation

[Include: Professional photo, maybe design mockup if available]
```

**WhatsApp Status:**

```
🚀 Big announcement: We're building PoultryCo - a professional 
platform for the poultry industry. Launching Jan 25 at PTSE.

Free tools + community for farmers who need help but can't 
afford expensive software yet.

Wish us luck! 🐔

[Include: Logo or simple graphic]

### Afternoon (2 hours): Technical Planning

**2:00-4:00 PM: Architecture & Tech Stack**

```
DECISIONS TO MAKE:

1. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
Decision: Monorepo vs Multi-repo?
Recommendation: Monorepo (easier for small team)

Structure:
/poultryco-monorepo
  /apps
    /mobile          (Expo/React Native)
    /web            (Next.js 15)

  /docs
    /architecture   (technical docs)
    /api           (API documentation)

2. BRANCHING STRATEGY
Decision: Git Flow vs GitHub Flow?
Recommendation: Simplified GitHub Flow

Strategy:

- dev (development, default)
- feature/* (feature branches)
- hotfix/* (urgent fixes)

Rules:
- No direct commits to main/dev

## DAY 4 (Thursday): INTERVIEW PREPARATION

```
INTERVIEW STRUCTURE (30 minutes each):

SECTION 1: Introduction (5 minutes)
"Hi [Name], thanks for your interest in PoultryCo! I'm Janagaran,
founder of PoultryCare, and I'll be leading this project.

Let me tell you quickly about what we're building, then I'd love 
to hear about you and why you're interested."

[Give 2-minute project overview - use excitement, vision]

SECTION 2: Background (8 minutes)
"Tell me about yourself:
• What year are you in?
• What have you studied in CS so far?
• What coding experience do you have? (projects, internships)
• What's your strongest skill? (frontend, backend, mobile, etc.)
• Have you worked on any team projects?"

[Listen for: actual experience, communication, passion]

SECTION 3: Technical Assessment (7 minutes)
"I'm not going to give you a coding test - I believe in learning 
on the job. But I am curious:

• If you had to build a mobile app, where would you start?
• Have you heard of React Native? What do you know about it?
• How comfortable are you with JavaScript/TypeScript?
• Have you used Git/GitHub? (it's okay if no)
• Are you comfortable Googling when stuck?"

[NOT looking for perfect answers - looking for problem-solving 
approach and willingness to learn]

SECTION 4: AI-First Development (5 minutes)
"We use AI-powered development tools. Have you heard of:
• Cursor IDE? (probably not - that's fine)
• Claude AI or ChatGPT for coding? (maybe)
• GitHub Copilot? (maybe)

Basically, we use AI to help write code faster. It's like having 
a senior developer helping you. You'll learn this methodology.

How do you feel about using AI tools for development?"

[Looking for: openness to new tools, not fear of AI]

SECTION 5: Logistics (3 minutes)
"Practical questions:
• When can you start? (looking for January 2025)
• How many hours can you commit per day? (need 6+ hours)
• Can you work remotely? Do you have laptop/internet?
• Our timeline is 12 weeks for MVP - can you commit?
• Expected stipend? (₹5-8K for dev, ₹10K for coordinator)"

SECTION 6: Questions from Candidate (2 minutes)
"What questions do you have for me?"

[Answer honestly, excitedly]

CLOSING:
"Thanks [Name]! I'm interviewing a few more candidates. I'll 
make a decision by [date] and let you know either way. Any final 
questions?"
```

• Coordinator
• All 5 developers
• Prabharan (optional, async update fine)
```

---

### Part 1: Sprint Goal (10 minutes)

```
YOU PRESENT:

"This sprint's goal is: [state goal]

Why this matters:
• [User value]
• [Business value]
• [Technical value]

By end of sprint, we should have:
• [Deliverable 1]
• [Deliverable 2]
• [Deliverable 3]

Questions about the goal?"

[Answer clarifying questions]
```

---

### Part 2: Task Breakdown (30 minutes)

```
GO THROUGH EACH USER STORY:

FOR EACH STORY:

1. READ THE STORY
   "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [reason]"
   
2. DISCUSS APPROACH
   Team: "How would we build this?"
   [Let team think through it]
   
3. BREAK INTO TASKS
   "What tasks are needed?"
   
   Example for "FCR Calculator":
   □ Design UI mockup
   □ Create calculator screen (React Native)
   □ Implement calculation logic
   □ Add input validation
   □ Save to database
   □ Show calculation history
   □ Write unit tests
   □ Deploy to dev
   
4. ESTIMATE EACH TASK
   Use Story Points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8):
   • 1 point: 2-4 hours
   • 2 points: 4-8 hours  
   • 3 points: 1-2 days
   • 5 points: 2-3 days
   • 8 points: 3-5 days (break down further!)
   
   Method: Planning Poker
   • Everyone shows estimate simultaneously
   • Discuss differences
   • Converge on number
   
5. ASSIGN OWNER
   "Who wants to own this?"
   [Volunteer or assign based on skills]
   
6. IDENTIFY DEPENDENCIES
   "Does this depend on anything?"
   [Mark dependencies clearly]
```

---

### Part 3: Capacity Check (10 minutes)

```
CALCULATE TEAM CAPACITY:

FORMULA:
Team Size × Days per Sprint × Hours per Day × Focus Factor

EXAMPLE:
5 developers × 10 days × 6 hours × 0.7 focus = 210 hours
= ~50-60 story points (if 1 point = 3-4 hours)

COMPARE:
• Team capacity: 50-60 points
• Sprint backlog: 65 points (from estimation)
• Verdict: Over capacity by 10-15%

ACTION:
□ Cut lowest priority items, OR
□ Move some tasks to next sprint

COMMITMENT:
"Can we commit to completing [X points] this sprint?"
[Get verbal agreement from team]
```

---

### Part 4: Final Checklist (5 minutes)

```
BEFORE ENDING MEETING:

✅ Sprint goal clear to everyone
✅ All tasks estimated
✅ All tasks assigned (owner)
✅ Dependencies identified
✅ Capacity realistic (not overcommitted)

# 12.4 USER TESTING PROTOCOL

## Overview: Test Early, Test Often

**Philosophy:**
```
"Don't wait for perfection. Test with real users from Week 4."

WHY TEST EARLY:
• Catch usability issues before they're baked in
• Validate assumptions (do users actually want this?)
• Build relationships with early adopters

Hi [Name],

I'm building something new for the poultry industry and would 
love your input.

It's called PoultryCo - a professional platform for farmers with 
free tools (FCR calculator, Q&A, networking). Think LinkedIn 
meets Stack Overflow for poultry.

We're looking for 10 farmers to test the early version (Week 4) 
and give honest feedback. It's rough around the edges, but your 
input will shape the final product.

WHAT'S INVOLVED:
• Install the app (Android/iOS)
• Use it for 1-2 weeks
• 30-min feedback call with me
• That's it!

WHAT YOU GET:
• Free tools forever (no charge)
• VIP status (founder member)
• Your name in credits (if you want)
• Help shape product for your needs

Interested? Reply yes and I'll add you to the alpha group.

Best,
Janagaran
```

## Final Encouragement

**From the Author:**

```
You've read 300+ pages of strategy, tactics, and execution plans.

Now comes the hard part: Actually doing it.

Here's the truth:
• Plans are worthless without execution
• Execution is messy (not clean like playbook)
• You'll face challenges not covered here
• Team will struggle, things will break
• You'll question the decision

But also:
• You have 35+ successful PoultryCare customers
• You know poultry industry deeply
• You have Prabharan's support
• You have ₹4L monthly revenue (stable)
• You have nothing to lose, everything to gain

This playbook gives you 70% of what you need.
The other 30%? Your grit, judgment, and execution.

12 weeks from now, you'll be on stage at PTSE saying:
"We launched PoultryCo. Here's what we built."

Not "We're planning to build..."
Not "We're thinking about..."
But "WE BUILT THIS."

That feeling? Worth every hour of effort.

Start tomorrow.
Actually, start today.
Right now.

Go change the poultry industry.
