## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Immediate Savings (Week 1)

```
❌ DON'T PAY FOR:
- Dedicated IPs (AWS SES): Save ₹28,000/year
- Enterprise plans: Save ₹2,00,000/year
- Paid analytics (use PostHog): Save ₹60,000/year
- Paid CDN (use Cloudflare free): Save ₹36,000/year
- Premium SMS routes: Save ₹10,000/year
TOTAL SAVINGS: ₹3,34,000/year

✅ DO PAY FOR:
- Cursor licenses: Critical for speed
- Pro tiers (Supabase, Vercel): Production needs
- Monitoring (Sentry): Essential for stability
```

### 2. Usage-Based Optimization

```
SMS COSTS (Variable):
✓ Email for non-urgent (₹0.01 vs ₹0.50)
✓ Daily batched alerts vs real-time
✓ SMS only for OTP and critical
→ Potential savings: ₹10,000/year

DATABASE COSTS (Fixed but scalable):
✓ Efficient queries (reduce API calls)
✓ Caching (reduce database load)
✓ Image optimization (reduce storage)
→ Delay upgrade need by 6-12 months

COMPUTING COSTS (Variable):
✓ Serverless (pay per use)
✓ Edge functions (faster + cheaper)
✓ Batch processing (non-peak hours)
→ Potential savings: ₹20,000/year
```

### 3. Strategic Decisions

```
BUILD vs BUY:
✓ Build: Profile system, tools, calculators
✗ Buy: Auth (Supabase), Monitoring (Sentry), Email (SES)

WHEN TO UPGRADE:
- Supabase → AWS RDS: At 40K-50K users
- Vercel Free → Pro: Needed immediately
- Cloudflare Free → Pro: Only if WAF needed
- Sentry Team → Business: At 50K+ users

WHEN TO DOWNGRADE:
- If growth slower than expected:
  - Cursor: Keep (productivity essential)
  - Sentry: Downgrade to Developer ($29→$9)
  - PostHog: Cloud free tier if usage low
→ Potential savings: ₹50,000/year

## When to Consider Paid Marketing

**NOT in Year 1**

```
YEAR 1 FOCUS:
❌ Google Ads
❌ Facebook Ads
❌ LinkedIn Ads
❌ Influencer marketing
❌ Paid sponsorships

✅ Organic only
✅ Association partnerships
✅ Events (in-person)
✅ Word-of-mouth
✅ SEO (long-term)

REASON:
- Target CAC: <₹10,000
- Organic achievable: ₹500-2,000
- Paid would be: ₹30,000-50,000
- Channel mismatch (farmers don't click ads)
- Budget too small for effective paid campaigns
```

**MAYBE in Year 2 (IF needed)**

```
CONSIDER PAID IF:
1. Organic growth plateaus
2. Specific regional expansion needed
3. Competition appears
4. Budget increases 5-10x

POTENTIAL CHANNELS (Year 2+):
- YouTube ads (farming channels): ₹5-10 per view
- WhatsApp Business API: ₹0.50-1 per message
- Regional newspaper/magazine: ₹20,000-50,000 per ad
- Radio ads (rural): ₹10,000-30,000 per campaign
- Event sponsorships: ₹50,000-1,00,000

TEST BUDGET: ₹50,000-1,00,000/month
Expected CAC: ₹5,000-15,000
Only proceed if <₹20,000 CAC

Planned: ₹28,000/month average
Actual: ₹42,000/month (+50%)
Annual impact: ₹1,68,000 vs ₹3,36,000
Overrun: ₹1,68,000
```

**CAUSES:**
- Faster user growth than expected
- Higher SMS usage (more price alerts)
- Additional Supabase storage needed
- More API calls

**MITIGATION STEPS:**
```
1. ANALYZE (Week 1):
   - Which service causing overrun?
   - Usage patterns & optimization opportunities
   - Forecast next 3 months

2. OPTIMIZE (Week 2):
   - Implement caching (reduce API calls)
   - Batch notifications (reduce SMS)
   - Compress images (reduce storage)
   - Expected savings: 20-30%

3. NEGOTIATE (Week 3):
   - Contact service providers
   - Volume discount discussions
   - Commitment discounts
   - Expected savings: 10-15%

4. MIGRATE IF NEEDED (Week 4+):
   - Supabase → AWS RDS (if at threshold)
   - Premium SMS → Standard (if alphanumeric not critical)
   - Paid monitoring → Self-hosted
   - Expected savings: 40-60%

5. USE CONTINGENCY:
   - Tier 2: ₹25,000 (covers 2 months)
   - Tier 1: ₹15,000 if critical
   - Total buffer: ₹40,000

6. FUNDING ADJUSTMENT:

```
Original overrun: ₹1,68,000
After optimization: ₹1,00,000 (-40%)
Contingency covers: ₹40,000
Additional needed: ₹60,000
Request from PTIC: ₹1,00,000 (buffer)
→ Manageable if growth justifies it
```

3. ACCELERATE (Week 14):
   - Junior dev works weekends (+₹5,000)
   - Hire freelancer for 2 weeks (+₹20,000)
   - Use contingency: ₹25,000
   - Ship partial MVP

4. ADJUST TIMELINE:

✅ Execute at 40-45K users
✅ Keep Supabase as fallback (1 month)
