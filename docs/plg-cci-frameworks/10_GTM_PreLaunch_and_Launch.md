- Create awareness (5,000+ people know about PoultryCo)
- Build waitlist (500+ pre-registrations)
- Secure partnerships (3+ associations committed)

• Communication happens in silos

WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:
• Professional profiles (showcase farms, connect)

• Q&A community (ask questions, get expert answers)
• Knowledge sharing (learn from each other)
• Market information (prices, trends)

PARTNERSHIP REQUEST:
1. Endorsement: Support PoultryCo as official association tool
2. Communication: Share launch announcement with members
3. Onboarding: Help us onboard first 100 members

WHAT WE PROVIDE:
• Free access for all members (forever)
• Training sessions (how to use platform)
• Priority support (dedicated help for association)
• Co-branding (association featured on platform)

NEXT STEPS:
I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call this week to discuss:
• Demo the platform (I'll show you what we're building)
• Discuss partnership structure
• Answer any questions
• Align on launch plan

Available times: [Calendly link]

This is an opportunity to provide real value to members at zero 
cost, while positioning [Association Name] as a forward-thinking

• Smile - warm, welcoming
• Eye contact - invite people in
• Open body language - no crossed arms
• Proactive greetings: "Good morning! Have you heard about 
  PoultryCo yet?"

THE 2-MINUTE PITCH:

[Person approaches booth]

"Hi! I'm Janagaran, founder of PoultryCo. We just launched 
today! Have you heard about us?"

[Most will say no]

"PoultryCo is like LinkedIn for the poultry industry. Let me 
show you real quick..."

[Pick up tablet, show app]

"See, you create a professional profile - showcase your farm, 
your experience. Then you can:
• Use free tools (FCR calculator - try it!)
• Ask questions (get answers from experts)
• Connect with other farmers
• Share knowledge

Everything's free, forever. No catch.

Want to sign up now? Takes 2 minutes."

[If yes: Help them sign up on the spot]
[If no: "No pressure! Here's a flyer. Visit poultryco.net 
anytime. Enjoy the conference!"]

# 10.4 ASSOCIATION PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

## Overview: Building Distribution Through Trust Networks

**Philosophy:**
```
"Farmers trust their associations more than they trust technology companies."

Individual farmer outreach: 1,000 conversations for 100 signups
Association partnership: 1 conversation for 300 signups

The math is obvious. Leverage existing trust networks.
```

**Partnership Goals:**
- Sign 3+ associations by Week 8 (pre-launch)
- Activate 5+ associations by Week 24 (6 months)
- Reach 10+ associations by Week 52 (Year 1)
- Deliver genuine value (not just user acquisition)
- Build long-term strategic relationships

Subject: Partnership Proposal: Free Professional Platform for [Association Name] Members

Dear [President/Chairman Name],

My name is Janagaran, and I'm reaching out in my capacity as:
â€¢ Founder of PoultryCare ERP (serving 35+ farms across 8 countries)
â€¢ President of PTIC (PoultryTech Innovation Council)
â€¢ Founder of PoultryCo (launching February 2025)

I'm writing because we're building something specifically for associations 
like [Association Name] and your members.

THE CHALLENGE WE'RE ADDRESSING:
Our industry survey (500+ farmers, 2024) revealed:
â€¢ 60% of independent farmers lack access to quality technology
â€¢ Industry knowledge is fragmented across WhatsApp groups
â€¢ Small farmers can't afford â‚¹50K-2L ERP systems
â€¢ Professional networking happens by chance, not by design

THE SOLUTION WE'RE BUILDING:
PoultryCo - A free professional platform for the poultry industry.
Think "LinkedIn + Stack Overflow + WhatsApp Communities" - but designed 
specifically for farmers, veterinarians, and industry professionals.

WHAT'S IN IT FOR [ASSOCIATION NAME]:

For Your Association:
âœ" Enhanced member value (at zero cost to you)
âœ" Modern communication channel

âœ" Q&A community (get expert answers)
âœ" Market information (live prices)
âœ" Networking (connect with peers)
âœ" Issue reporting (direct to PTIC)

BUSINESS MODEL:
â€¢ Free tier: All core features (forever)
â€¢ Premium ERP: Optional upgrade for larger farms (100K+ birds)
â€¢ No hidden costs, no bait-and-switch

YOUR MEMBERS WILL ALWAYS HAVE FREE ACCESS.

WHAT WE'RE ASKING:

Partnership Structure:
1. Endorsement: Support PoultryCo as official member tool
2. Communication: Share launch announcement (email, meeting)

â€¢ Official launch: PTSE 3rd Edition (Feb 22, 2025)
â€¢ Association rollout: March 2025
â€¢ Full deployment: April 2025

CREDIBILITY:
â€¢ PoultryCare ERP: â‚¹4L MRR, proven technology
â€¢ PTIC: Section 8 non-profit, industry backing
â€¢ Team: 10+ years poultry technology experience
â€¢ Mission: Serve the 60% of farmers who are underserved

NEXT STEP:
I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call to:
â€¢ Demo the platform (show you what we're building)
â€¢ Understand your members' specific needs

Available times: [Calendly link]

This is an opportunity to provide genuine value to your members 
at zero cost to the association. I believe together we can make 
a real difference for independent farmers.

**Follow-up Sequence:**

```
DAY 3 (if no response):
Subject: Re: Partnership Proposal - Quick Question

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from Monday. I know you're busy, so 
I wanted to ask:

Is this something you'd be interested in exploring? If not, 
no problem at all - just let me know so I don't bother you again.

If yes, I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
Janagaran

DAY 7 (if no response):
Subject: Final follow-up: PoultryCo Partnership

Hi [Name],

This is my last follow-up - I don't want to be a pest!

I genuinely believe PoultryCo can help [Association Name] members, 
but I respect that timing might not be right or it might not be a fit.

If you'd like to explore this, I'm here. Otherwise, I'll assume 
you're not interested and won't reach out again.

Either way, best wishes to you and your members.

Best regards,
Janagaran

```

**Call Structure:**

```
OPENING (3 minutes):

âœ… Personal connection
   "Thank you for taking the time. I know [mutual connection] 
   spoke highly of the work you're doing with [Association]."

âœ… Context setting
   "I wanted to share what we're building and see if it might 
   be valuable for your members. This is a genuine partnership 
   offer - we're not selling anything to you or your members."

âœ… Permission to continue
   "Does that sound okay? I have about 25 minutes worth of 
   information, but happy to adjust based on what's most 
   useful to you."

---

DISCOVERY (10 minutes):

Ask Questions (Don't Pitch Yet!):

About Members:
âž" "Can you tell me about your typical member? What size 
   operations do they run?"
   
âž" "What are the biggest challenges your members face today?"

âž" "How do members currently communicate with each other? 
   WhatsApp groups? Meetings?"

âž" "What percentage of your members would you say are 
   comfortable with mobile apps?"

About Association:
âž" "What services does the association currently provide?"

âž" "How do you typically communicate with members? 
   Email? WhatsApp? Physical meetings?"

âž" "What's your biggest challenge in engaging members?"

âž" "Have you tried any digital tools before? What worked 
   or didn't work?"

LISTEN ACTIVELY. TAKE NOTES.
Their answers will shape your pitch.

---

DEMONSTRATION (8 minutes):

Now, tailor pitch based on what you learned:

"Based on what you shared, let me show you three things that 
might be particularly relevant..."

SHOW:
1. Feature most relevant to their stated need
   Example: If they said "members ask same questions repeatedly"
   â†' Show Q&A community with search

2. Tool addressing biggest member pain point
   Example: If they said "FCR tracking is inconsistent"
   â†' Demo FCR calculator

3. Association benefit they care about most
   Example: If they said "member engagement is low"
   â†' Show activity analytics dashboard

SHARE SCREEN. Make it visual and tangible.

---

ADDRESSING CONCERNS (5 minutes):

Common Objections & Responses:

OBJECTION: "Our members aren't tech-savvy."
RESPONSE: 
"I hear that concern. That's exactly why we're building this 
mobile-first with Tamil language support. The farmers we've 
tested with - average age 45-50 - picked it up in under 5 minutes. 
We'll provide hands-on training sessions to make onboarding smooth."

OBJECTION: "Members already use WhatsApp. Why another platform?"
RESPONSE:
"Great question! We're not replacing WhatsApp - we're complementing 
it. WhatsApp is for conversations, PoultryCo is for tools and 
structured knowledge. Think of it as: WhatsApp for chat, PoultryCo 
for getting things done. Plus, we integrate with WhatsApp for 
notifications."

OBJECTION: "What if members have to pay later?"
RESPONSE:
"I want to be crystal clear: core features will be free forever. 
We're backed by PoultryCare (which makes money from larger farms 
needing ERP) and PTIC (non-profit). Your members under 100K birds 
will never be asked to pay. We're serving them because it's the 
right thing to do AND it helps us find larger customers who do 
need paid ERP."

OBJECTION: "We don't have budget for this."
RESPONSE:
"There's no cost to you or your members. Zero. The only thing 
we're asking for is your endorsement and help with rollout - 
basically, a message to members saying 'we've checked this out 
and it's valuable.' Everything else we handle."

OBJECTION: "How do we know this will actually help members?"
RESPONSE:
"Fair question. We're starting with a pilot: Let's onboard 20-30 
of your most active members first. After 4 weeks, we'll survey 
them. If they don't find it valuable, we part ways - no hard 
feelings. If they do, we roll out to everyone. Does that reduce 
the risk for you?"

---

CLOSE (4 minutes):

âœ… Summarize mutual understanding
   "So to recap: you need [X, Y, Z] and we can provide [solutions]. 
   Does that sound right?"

âœ… Outline next steps
   "If you're interested in moving forward, here's what I suggest:
   
   1. This week: I'll send you the formal partnership proposal and MoU
   2. Next week: You review with your board/committee
   3. Week after: We sign MoU and plan pilot with 20-30 members
   4. Following month: Beta testing period
   5. February: Official launch at PTSE
   
   Does that timeline work for you?"

âœ… Get commitment or clear no
   "What do you think? Is this something you'd like to explore?"

âœ… Thank them
   "Thank you so much for your time. Regardless of whether we 
   partner, I'm here to support your members and the industry."

---

POST-CALL:

Within 24 hours:
â–¡ Send thank-you email
â–¡ Attach partnership materials discussed
â–¡ Confirm next steps and timeline
â–¡ Log notes in CRM
â–¡ Set reminder for follow-up
```
