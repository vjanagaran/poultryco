## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. **Mobile-Only MVP** (No desktop version)
**Why:** 75-97% usage on mobile in emerging markets, rural farmers don't have PCs

### 2. **Phone Number Primary Identity** (Not email)
**Why:** Phone = primary identity in rural India, email penetration low

### 3. **Offline-First Architecture**
**Why:** Rural connectivity unreliable, WhatsApp success model

### 4. **Free Forever for Core Features**
**Why:** Trust building, community growth, Doximity/Wikipedia model

### 5. **Multi-Language from Day 1** (Tamil/English minimum)
**Why:** 2-4x adoption rate with local language

### 6. **Reputation Before Features**
**Why:** Trust = adoption in agriculture, Stack Overflow success proof

### 7. **Industry-Specific Before Generic**
**Why:** Doximity 80% penetration by being vertical-specific
