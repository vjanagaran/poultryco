## 📊 DATA STRUCTURE & COVERAGE

### Historical Data (10+ Years)
```
Zones Covered:
- Production Centers (PC): ~25 zones
- Consumption Centers (CC): ~15 zones
- Total: ~40 zones × 365 days × 10+ years = 146,000+ data points

Data Points Per Day:
- NECC Suggested Price (per zone)
- Prevailing Market Price (per zone)
- Monthly Average (calculated)
- Day of month (1-31)
- Year/Month context
```

### Key Zones to Prioritize
**High Volume Zones:**
1. Namakkal (Tamil Nadu) - Largest production hub
2. Hyderabad (Telangana) - Major consumption
3. Mumbai (Maharashtra) - Major consumption
4. Bengaluru (Karnataka) - Major consumption
5. Chennai (Tamil Nadu) - Major consumption
6. Kolkata (West Bengal) - Major consumption
7. Pune (Maharashtra) - Production + Consumption
8. Ajmer (Rajasthan) - Production hub

**Why These Matter:**
- Namakkal sets the trend (production hub)
- Consumption centers show demand patterns
- Cross-zone analysis reveals supply chain dynamics

---

## 🧠 EXPERT INSIGHTS (BV Rao Perspective)

### What Would BV Rao Want to See?

**1. Anomaly Detection**
- "This spike is unusual - last time this happened was 2018 during feed crisis"
- "Namakkal up 10% but Mumbai only 3% - supply chain bottleneck"
- "All zones up simultaneously - likely feed price increase"

**2. Seasonal Patterns**
- "Every year, prices drop 15% in March-April (summer demand dip)"
- "Festival season (Oct-Nov) typically sees 20% premium"
- "Monsoon months show highest volatility"

**3. Cross-Zone Analysis**
- "When Namakkal rises, Mumbai follows in 2-3 days (transit time)"
- "Price gap between production and consumption zones = transport cost"
- "Zone correlation matrix - which zones move together?"

**4. Supply Chain Insights**
- "Feed price increase → egg price increase (2-3 week lag)"
- "Disease outbreak in one zone → price spike in neighboring zones"
- "Transport strike → price divergence between zones"

**5. Market Psychology**
- "Panic selling creates temporary dip, then recovery"
- "Festival demand creates artificial spike, then correction"
- "Export demand vs domestic demand patterns"

## 💬 EXPERT ANNOTATION SYSTEM

### Annotation Types

**1. Spike Analysis**
```
Date: Jan 15, 2025
Zone: Namakkal
Price: ₹640 (up from ₹605)
Expert: BV Rao
Type: Spike Analysis

Title: "Feed Price Increase Driving Egg Prices"

Analysis:
"This 6% spike is directly linked to the feed price increase 
announced by major feed manufacturers last week. Layer feed 
costs have increased by ₹2/kg, which translates to ₹0.15 
per egg. This is a sustainable increase, not a bubble.

Expected Duration: 2-3 weeks until feed prices stabilize.

Action for Farmers:
- If you have inventory, consider selling in next 2-3 days
- If buying feed, lock in prices now before further increase
- Monitor feed prices closely - they're the key driver"

Tags: #feed-prices #sustainable-spike #actionable
```

**2. Trend Explanation**
```
Date: Jan 1-17, 2025
Zone: All Zones
Expert: BV Rao
Type: Trend Analysis

Title: "January 2025: Steady Upward Trend Across All Zones"

Analysis:
"January typically sees a 5-8% price increase due to:
1. Post-festival demand recovery
2. Winter production dip (colder weather = lower production)
3. New Year demand surge

This year's 6% average increase is within normal range. 
The trend is healthy and sustainable.

What to Watch:
- If prices cross ₹650 in next 2 weeks, that's above normal
- Monitor feed prices - any increase will amplify this trend
- Festival season (Feb-Mar) will likely push prices higher"

Tags: #seasonal-trend #january-pattern #normal-range
```

**3. Anomaly Explanation**
```
Date: Jan 10, 2025
Zone: Mumbai
Price: ₹635 (down from ₹650)
Expert: BV Rao
Type: Anomaly Explanation

Title: "Mumbai Price Dip: Temporary or Trend?"

Analysis:
"Mumbai prices dropped 2.3% while other zones remained stable. 
This is likely due to:
1. Local oversupply from nearby farms
2. Transport disruption resolved (more supply reached market)
3. Temporary market correction

This is NOT a trend - expect recovery in 2-3 days as supply 
normalizes. Other zones (Namakkal, Hyderabad) remain strong, 
indicating overall market health.

Action: If you're in Mumbai, this is a buying opportunity, 
not a selling signal."

Tags: #temporary-dip #local-factor #buying-opportunity
```

**4. Future Prediction**
```
Date: Jan 17, 2025
Zone: All Zones
Expert: BV Rao
Type: 30-Day Forecast

Title: "February 2025 Price Outlook"

Prediction:
"Based on current trends and historical patterns, I expect:
- Week 1-2 Feb: ₹620-640 (stable)
- Week 3-4 Feb: ₹640-670 (festival demand)
- Peak: ₹680-700 possible during festival week

Key Factors:
✅ Feed prices stable (if they stay)
✅ Festival demand (Feb-Mar)
✅ Winter production dip continues
⚠️ Watch for: Any feed price increase will push prices higher

Confidence: 75% (high confidence in trend, moderate in exact prices)

Disclaimer: This is expert opinion based on current data. 
Market conditions can change rapidly."
