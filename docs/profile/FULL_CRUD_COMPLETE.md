## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
Each section follows the same pattern:
1. **Main Component**: Displays list + handles modal state
2. **Modal Component**: Form for add/edit
3. **Delete Button Component**: Handles deletion with confirmation

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Modal Open → Form Submit → Supabase Insert/Update/Delete → 
Profile Context Refresh → UI Update → Modal Close
```

### Key Functions
- `handleSubmit()` - Save/update data to Supabase
- `handleDelete()` - Delete with confirmation
- `fetchProfile()` - Refresh profile data from context
- `formatDate()` - Format dates for display

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all database operations
- User-friendly error alerts
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## 🎯 Profile Strength Impact

Adding these sections significantly impacts profile strength:

| Section | Points | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Add 1+ Experience | 10 pts | +10% strength |
| Add 1+ Education | 10 pts | +10% strength |
| Add 1+ Skill | 10 pts | +10% strength |
| **Total Possible** | **30 pts** | **+30% strength** |

Completing all three sections takes a profile from 70% to 100%!
