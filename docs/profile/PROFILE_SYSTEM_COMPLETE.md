## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Image Processing Flow
1. User selects or drags image
2. **Client-side validation** (file type, size)
3. **Convert to WebP** using Canvas API
4. **Resize**:
   - Avatar: 400x400px square (center crop)
   - Cover: 1500x500px (maintain aspect ratio)
5. **Upload to Supabase Storage** with upsert
6. **Update profile table** with full URL + cache-busting timestamp
7. **Refresh profile data** in context

### Image Utility Functions
```typescript
validateImage(file: File)                    // Check size and type
convertToWebP(file, width, height?, quality) // Convert and resize
uploadAvatar(file, userId)                   // Upload avatar
uploadCover(file, userId)                    // Upload cover
deletePhoto(path)                            // Delete from storage
getAvatarUrl(userId)                         // Get avatar public URL
getCoverUrl(userId)                          // Get cover public URL
```

### Profile Strength Algorithm
```typescript
// Point Distribution (100 points total)
Basic Info:      30 points
  - Name:         5 points
  - Headline:    10 points
  - Avatar:      10 points
  - Cover:        5 points

Contact:         15 points
  - Email:        5 points
  - Phone:        5 points
  - State:        3 points
  - City:         2 points

About:           15 points
  - Bio:         15 points

Professional:    40 points
  - Roles:       10 points
  - Skills:      10 points
  - Experience:  10 points
  - Education:   10 points
```

const file = e.target.files[0];
const result = await uploadAvatar(file, user.id);

if (result.success) {
  await updateProfile({ profile_photo_url: result.url });
}
```

### Calculating Profile Strength
```tsx
import { calculateProfileStrength } from '@/lib/profile/profileStrength';

const strength = calculateProfileStrength(profile);
console.log(strength.percentage);        // 65
console.log(strength.level);            // 'advanced'
console.log(strength.missingFields);    // [{ field, label, points, tip }]
```

### Updating Profile
```tsx
const { updateProfile } = useProfile();

await updateProfile({
  headline: 'Poultry Farmer & Consultant',
  bio: 'Experienced in layer farming...',
});
```

## 🔐 Security & Performance

### Security Features
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on storage
- ✅ Path validation (users can only access own photos)
- ✅ File type validation (MIME types)
- ✅ File size limits (10MB)
- ✅ Server-side checks via Supabase policies

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ WebP format (30-50% smaller than JPEG/PNG)
- ✅ Optimized image dimensions (no oversized uploads)
- ✅ Cache-busting URLs (timestamp parameter)
- ✅ Lazy loading with Next.js Image component
- ✅ Client-side image processing (offload server)

## 📝 SQL Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Add Cover Photo Column
```bash
# Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
supabase/schema/21_add_cover_photo.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Storage Setup
```sql
-- Check bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'cdn-poultryco';

-- Check policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
AND schemaname = 'storage';
```
