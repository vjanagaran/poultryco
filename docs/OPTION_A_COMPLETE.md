  .from('profiles')
  .select('id, full_name, profile_slug, headline, profile_photo_url')
  .or(`full_name.ilike.%${searchQuery}%,profile_slug.ilike.%${searchQuery}%`)
  .limit(10);

// Filter out existing team members
const existingIds = new Set(existingMembers?.map(m => m.profile_id));
const filteredResults = data?.filter(user => !existingIds.has(user.id));
```

### **Multi-Image Upload:**
```typescript
// Upload multiple images with order tracking
for (let i = 0; i < uploadingImages.length; i++) {
  const file = uploadingImages[i];
  const result = await uploadToStorage(file, `products/${businessId}`, productId);
  
  await supabase.from('product_images').insert({
    product_id: productId,
    image_url: result.url,
    is_primary: i === 0, // First image is primary
    sort_order: i,
  });
}
```

### **Access Control:**
```typescript
// Server-side check in edit page
const isOwner = business.owner_id === user.id;
const { data: teamMember } = await supabase
  .from('business_team_members')
  .select('is_admin')
  .eq('business_profile_id', business.id)
  .eq('profile_id', user.id)
