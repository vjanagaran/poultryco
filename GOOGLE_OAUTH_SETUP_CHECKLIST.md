https://www.poultryco.net/terms

Ensure you have a valid email:
```
Email: team@poultryco.net
```

Verify you have the necessary scopes:
- ‚úÖ `email` - See your primary Google Account email address
- ‚úÖ `profile` - See your personal info, including any personal info you've made publicly available
- ‚úÖ `openid` - Associate you with your personal info on Google

**These should already be configured if Google Auth is working.**

## 5. Test Users (If in Testing Mode)

**Testing Mode:**
- ‚úÖ Free, no verification needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to 100 users

## 9. Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"
**Fix:** Make sure authorized domains include `poultryco.net`

### Issue: "403: access_denied"
**Fix:** If in Testing mode, add user to test users list

### Issue: Privacy/Terms links show 404
**Fix:** Deploy the new pages to production first:
```bash
# From workspace root
cd apps/web
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel (or your hosting)
vercel --prod
```

### Issue: Redirect URI mismatch
**Fix:** Add authorized redirect URIs:
```
https://www.poultryco.net/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback  (for development)
```

## 10. Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use HTTPS for all URLs (production)
- Keep client secret secure (never commit to git)
- Regularly review authorized users
- Monitor OAuth usage in Google Console

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Share client ID/secret publicly
- Use HTTP in production
- Request unnecessary scopes
- Skip email verification
